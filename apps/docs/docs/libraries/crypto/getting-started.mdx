# Getting Started

---

Welcome to the Crypto Library, a crucial component of the Softkit ecosystem. This library offers comprehensive services and utilities for cryptography and pseudo-random data generation.

:::note
This library is tightly integrated with the Softkit ecosystem and is intended for use within this specific context.
:::

## Installation

To get started, install the library using the following command:

```bash
yarn add @softkit/crypto
```

## Features

### Cryptography

- **Password Hashing**: Uses `argon2` for secure password hashing.
- **Password Verification**: Provides an easy way to verify passwords against hashed values.

### Pseudo Random Data Generation

- **NanoID**: Generates unique identifiers using `nanoid`.
- **Custom Alphabet**: Allows creation of IDs with a custom set of characters.
- **Number Generation**: Capable of generating random numbers for various applications.

### Under the Hood

This library utilizes [`argon2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argon2) and [`nanoid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) to ensure efficient and up-to-date cryptographic operations.

For optimal performance and compatibility, this library is recommended for use within the Softkit ecosystem.
