# Getting Started

---

This library enhances the [`@softkit/typeorm`](/libraries/typeorm/getting-started) library by providing essential base services for your application. It also integrates seamlessly with the [`@softkit/exceptions`](/libraries/exceptions/getting-started) library for standardized exception handling.

## Installation

To get started, install the library using the following command:

```bash
yarn add @softkit/service-api
```

## Quick Overview

The TypeORM Service Library offers two core services:

- [`BaseEntityService`](/api/service-api/src/classes/BaseEntityService/): Facilitates CRUD operations and can be extended for custom business logic.
- [`BaseTenantEntityService`](/api/service-api/src/classes/BaseTenantEntityService/): Similar to `BaseEntityService`, but tailored for multi-tenant applications.

Both services support generic exclusion of auto-generated fields, enhancing type safety and minimizing development errors.

## Key Features

### Custom Types

- Enhances error detection at the compilation level.
- The `save` method requires all essential fields to manage an entity effectively.

### Partial Update Method

- Features a separate method for partial updates.
- Utilizes deep partial type as input, allowing for selective updates.

### Soft Remove Functionality

- Provides `archive` and `unarchive` methods.
- Marks entities as deleted by setting the `deletedAt` timestamp.

### Transaction Support

- All methods are adorned with the `@Transactional` decorator.
- Default transaction propagation is set to REQUIRED.
