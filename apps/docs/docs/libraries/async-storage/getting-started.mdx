# Getting Started

---

This is a simple wrapper to setup a Cls Async Storage, which utilizes [`nestjs-cls`](https://papooch.github.io/nestjs-cls/) behind the scenes for robust context handling.

:::note
This utility is tailored for the Softkit ecosystem and is not intended for use outside of this context.

## Installation

To get started, install the library using the following command:

```bash
yarn add @softkit/async-storage
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can set up the library in your application module as follows:

```typescript
import { setupClsModule } from '@softkit/async-storage';
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

@Module({
  imports: [setupClsModule()],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This initializes the library with default settings suitable for most applications.

For more advanced configuration options and detailed explanations of the [`setupClsModule`](/api/async-storage/src/functions/setupClsModule/) function, see the [Advanced Setup](/libraries/async-storage/advanced-setup.mdx)
