# Getting Started

---

This library provides a health check endpoint for applications, suitable for Kubernetes and other environments requiring health checks.

:::note
This module is tight to Softkit ecosystem and there is no point to use it outside.
:::

## Installation

To get started, install the library using the following command:

```bash
yarn add @softkit/health-check
```

## Basic Usage in Your Main App Module

- Import `HealthCheckModule` and register it in the imports array.
- Add `HealthConfig` to your `RootConfig` class.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { HealthCheckModule } from '@softkit/health-check';

@Module({
  imports: [
    HealthCheckModule,
    // other imports
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

import { HealthConfig } from '@softkit/health-check';

export default class RootConfig implements PlatformClientConfig {
  @Type(() => HealthConfig)
  @ValidateNested()
  public readonly health!: HealthConfig;
}
```

- Include health configurations in your `.env.yaml` file:

```yaml
health:
  disk:
    enabled: true
  db:
    enabled: true
```

With these steps, the health endpoint `/health` will be activated in your application.

## Configuration Options and Defaults

Customize the health check configuration to suit your application needs:

- **Disk Health Check**:

  - `path`: The path to check the disk space. Default is `'/'`.
  - `thresholdPercent`: The minimum disk space threshold as a percentage. Default is `0.8` (80%).
  - `enabled`: Determines if the disk space check is enabled. Default is `true`.

- **Database Health Check**:
  - `enabled`: Determines if the database health check is enabled. Default is `true`.

## Behind the Scenes

The library leverages [nestjs/terminus](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus) for implementing health checks.
