Leverage the Swagger Utils Library to configure multiple Swagger instances for various API access levels, like public and private endpoints. Tailor the Swagger setup to meet the specific documentation needs of your application.

## Environment-Specific Swagger Configuration

You can manage environment-specific settings, such as disabling the writing of the `open-api.json` file in production environments:

## Multiple Swagger Instances

The Swagger Utils Library supports multiple Swagger setups for different API access levels, such as public and private endpoints.

### Implementing Multiple Swagger Setups

Here's how you can configure multiple Swagger instances within your application:

```typescript
import { setupSwagger } from '@softkit/swagger-utils';

const appPrefix = 'api';
const publicSwaggerSetup = setupSwagger(publicSwaggerConfig, app, appPrefix);
const privateSwaggerSetup = setupSwagger(privateSwaggerConfig, app, appPrefix);
```

## Conclusion

Effective API documentation management is simplified with the Swagger Utils Library, ensuring that developers and consumers of your API have access to accurate and detailed information.
